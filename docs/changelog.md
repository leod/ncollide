#Release notes

This lists the change brought by all major releases. The corresponding source
code may be found based on tags on
[github](https://github.com/sebcrozet/ncollide/releases).

### Version 0.14.0
#### Added
  * Update to nalgebra 0.14.
  * The EPA algorithm in both 2D and 3D.
  * Vorono√Ø region based simplex projection algorithms for 2D and 3D (and
    used for the GJK instead of the n-dimensional Johnson algorithm).
  * `SupportMap::support_point_toward` that takes a direction that is already
      normalized.

#### Modified
* The `Plane` geometry is now initialized with a `Unit` vector. Its `.normal()` method also returns a `Unit` vector.
* The `Contact<...>` structure now represents the contact normal as a `Unit<P::Vector>` instead of just a `P::Vector`.
* All the fields of `CollisionObject` are now private and must be accessed using methods.
* The trait Point now requires additional methods to compute the normal of
  a face and to project the origin on it.
* Everything is now Send/Sync (useful for, e.g., ECS compatibility). 
* Rename `RichPointQuery` -> `PointQueryWithLocation`.
* Rename `RichPointQuery::project_point_with_extra_info` -> `PointQueryWithLocation::project_point_with_location`.
* Rename `CollisionWorld::deferred_add          -> CollisionWorld::add`. Now, the addition is performed immediately.
* Rename `CollisionWorld::deferred_remove       -> CollisionWorld::remove`. Now, the removal is performed immediately.
* Rename `CollisionWorld::deferred_set_position -> CollisionWorld::set_position`. Now, the change of position is performed immediately.
* The interface of `BroadPhase` has been significantly altered: now the uid
  allocated to each object added to the broad phase is automatically
  generated by the broad phase itself.
* Rename `BroadPhase::deferred_remove -> BroadPhase::remove`. Now the
  removal is performed immediately.

### Version 0.12.0
#### Modified
* The `ShapeHandle` is now a `Arc<Shape<P, M>>` instead of `Arc<Box<Shape<P, M>>>`
(this removes one allocation indirection).
* Update to nalgebra 0.12.0.

-----

### Version 0.11.0
* Update to nalgebra 0.11.0.

-----

### Version 0.10.0
#### Added
* Re-export `Ray2`, `Ray3`, `RayIntersection2`, and `RayIntersection3` on the
  `query` module.
#### Modified
* Rename `.perform_removals_and_broad_phase()` -> `.perform_additions_removals_and_broad_phase()`.
* Rename the collision world method `.add()` to `.deferred_add()`.
* The collision world `.deferred_set_position()` now fails with a meaningful
  error when the user attempts to set the position of an object not actually
  added (including those that have been `.deferred_add()`-ed without a
  subsequent `.update()`.

-----

### Version 0.9.0
#### Added

* Added 2D and 3D testbeds (available on crates.io as `ncollide_testbed2d` and `ncollide_testbed3d`).
* Added a method to the narrow phase to retrieve all the proximity pairs.
* Added a method to the collision world to retrieve all the proximity pairs.
* Added a method to the collision world to retrieve the collision object from
  its identifier.

#### Modified

* Merge the `ncollide_queries` and `ncollide_entities` crates into
  `ncollide_geometry`.
* Rename the `geometry` module to `query`.
* `::implicit_shape_aabb(...)` becomes `::support_map_aabb(...)`
* `CompositeShape::aabb_at(...)` now returns an AABB by-value (instead of
  by-ref).
* `PointQuery::distance_to_point(...)` now has a `solid` flag as well.
* Point queries result now indicates if the point was inside of the object
  or not by returning a `PointProjection` structure instead of just the
  point.
* Rename `CollisionGroups::can_collide_with` to `CollisionGroups::can_interact_with`.
* Rename `NarrowPhase::handle_proximity` to `NarrowPhase::handle_interaction`.
* Rename all `.*CollisionDetector` to `.*ContactGenerator`. Methods have
  been renamed as well (e.g. `.get_collision_algorithm` becomes
  `.get_contact_algorithm`, `.colls` becomes `.contacts`, etc.)
* Rename `CollisionQueryType` to `GeometricQueryType`.
* Moved the `ray` and `point` modules into the `query` module. Also, they
  are renamed `ray_internal` and `point_internal`.

#### Removed

* Removed the `CompositeShape::len()` method.

-----

### Version 0.8.0
#### Added

* Added proximity queries, including persistant proximity detector and
  algorithm dispatcher.
* Added methods to set directly collision group membership/whitelist/blacklist.

#### Modified

* The last type parameter of the `BVTCostFn` trait (the user-defined data
  return by leaves) is now an associated type.
* The shape handles `Arc<Box<Repr<P, M>>>` are now wrapped into a structure
  with a more explicit name: `ShapeHandle<P, M>`.
* Renamed `Convex` to `ConvexHull`
* Swapped the first two arguments of `CompositeShape::map_transformed_part_at`.
* All fields of `Polyline` are now private. Added corresponding accessors.
